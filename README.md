## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I’m **Tushar Rathore**, a self-driven **React & Full-Stack JavaScript Developer** passionate about building complete, real-world web applications.

I focus on:

- Clean & modern UI  
- Smooth UX  
- Full-stack functionality  
- Scalable project structures  
- Real products, not just sample apps  

I’ve built multiple production-style applications including a workforce management system, a travel listing platform, and a modern banking UI.

Alongside my BSc studies, I consistently work on improving my engineering skills, learning new patterns, and creating projects that solve real problems.
